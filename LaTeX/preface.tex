\section*{Preface}

First of all, thanks to my supervisor, Leif Anders Thorsrud, for introducing me to Big Data and its applications in economics. Thank you for supporting me on my way to becoming a better econometrician.

I would also like to thank the research department at Norges Bank for letting me occupy a desk during the writing, and my office mate, Eyo Herstad, for great discussions during many coffee breaks. Also, I want to thank Nina Larsson Midthjell at the bank, for being a great mentor for me the last couple of years and helping me get in touch with my supervisor.

From Blindern, I would like to thank Professor Steinar Holden for awarding me the scholarship in macro and monetary policy issues for this thesis.

Last, I want to thank my wife, Kaja, for all her support during the process.

Although I have occupied a desk at Norges Bank during the writing, this thesis is not linked to Norges Bank in any way. And of course, any errors in the thesis are my own.
